Description: 'HPTuning' is a program that performs hyper-parameter tuning of different Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms using:
  random search (RS), meta-heuristics (GA, PSO and EDA), sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) and an Iterated F-Racing technique (irace).
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0), mlr (>= 2.15), ParamHelpers(>= 1.12), checkmate, RWeka (>= 0.4), irace, GA, pso, copulaedas, mlrMBO (>= 1.1.2)
Suggests: rpart, e1071, randomForest, party, xgboost, e1071, C50, glmnet, kknn
